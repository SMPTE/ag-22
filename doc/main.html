  <title>Public Committee Draft (Public CD) Process</title>
</head>

<body>

  <section id="sec-introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Review of an engineering document by the public, beyond the members of the SMPTE Standards Community, can help determine if it meets industry needs and satisfies interoperability requirements. Such a review ideally takes place before the engineering document reaches Final Committee Draft, after which making substantial changes becomes increasingly complex.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sec-scope">
    <p>This Administrative Guideline specifies the process for Public Committee Drafts (<a>Public CD</a>), which are Committee Drafts made available to the public for review.</p>

    <p class="note">A <a>Public CD</a> was referred to as a Technical Specification between 2018 and 2019.</p>

    <section id="sec-general">
      <h3>General (Informative)</h3> 

      <p>The development of a <a>Public CD</a> is conducted according to the SMPTE <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, including, but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the decision to make a Committee Draft available to the public rests with the Standards Vice President (<a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, Section 9.3.1);</li>
        <li>contributions to a <a>Public CD</a> are subject to intellectual property and confidentiality policy specified
in <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, Section 9;</li>
        <li>decisions are based on consensus, as defined in <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, Section 4.1;</li>
        <li>the Project Group can return the <a>Public CD</a> to the Technology Committee Chair for FCD ballot at
any time (<a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, Section 6.5).</li>

    <section id="sec-creation">
      <h3>Creation</h3> 

      <p>Any Committee Draft may be made available as a <a>Public CD</a> if it meets the following criteria:</p>

        <li>the Committee Draft has not been previously made available as a <a>Public CD</a> and subsequently terminated, as specified in <a href="#sec-termination"></a>.</li>
        <li>by Consensus and usually following a recommendation of a Project Group, the TC has recommended to the Standards Vice President that the Committee Draft be made available as a <a>Public CD</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The TC recommendation should include a brief text appropriate for a public announcement of the <a>Public CD</a>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the document begins its FCD ballot (<a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, Section 6.6), at which point the notice specified in <a href="#sec-notice-of-fcd"></a> shall be displayed prominently alongside the <a>Public CD</a>; or</li>

        <li>the Committee Draft of the document is revised</li>
        <li>more than 1095 days have elapsed since the document was initially made available as a <a>Public CD</a>, unless the Standards Vice President elects to extend the period upon recommendation of the TC</li>
