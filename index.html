    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Review of an engineering document by the public, beyond the members of the SMPTE Standards Community, can help determine if it meets industry needs and satisfies interoperability requirements. Such a review ideally takes place before the engineering document reaches Final Committee Draft, after which making substantial changes becomes increasingly complex.</p>
